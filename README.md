### Project Notes

This is one of my first web pages and represents my second time experimenting with Bootstrap. I'm proud of how much I've learned, but I also have soooo far to go until I am truly a skilled front-end developer.

#### Strengths:
* Compared to my first project, I did a lot better with responsive design this time.
* I experimented with jQuery and it was only kind of scary.
* This is a great starting point. I built something from scratch that I can now tweak and fix as I learn more!

#### Things to Improve:
* I should edit the **Portfolio** screenshots to make them more attractive.
* The color scheme is quite plain. (Maybe that's a good thing?)
* Once I get more stuff in my **Portfolio**, that should go before the **About Me** section.
* This is fine while I'm a student, but I'll need a more professional tone once I'm actually looking for work.

I'm always looking to learn new things and meet new people. Feel free to contact me if you want to learn together!
